        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Here is a bit more FAQ, which many may ask:</li><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Why do you create this page for marketing? This theme sucks!</em>
              <br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><p>If you ask such a question, one is you might be a fullstack developer with a strong academic and research background. To you, I had like to say beech please, there are so many strong programming musclemen who love this HTML 90s retro theme. What is more artistic than a week long intensive creation of a HTML based CV rather than a monday/wix based solution? I think it conveys a strong sense of knowledge in subject matter and the tenacity to demonstrate that knowledge by taking a hard way out rather than one easy way out. Number two, I am learning bros! I am took <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12287450#overview">Angela Ng's course on web development in Udemy</a> and this is the best platform to demonstrate my programming strength and expertise as a <em><strong>"foolstack"</strong>web developer</em>.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <em>What is your vision for the world?</em>
              <br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><p>I want to put a small ding in the universe, in fact it is so microscopic. Yes, I have big dreams for the world but I believe with the direction the world is moving, entrepreneurs are employing money baiting tactics to make short - term profits and dissapear entirely. Honestly, this is not what I want and I want to set an example that my freelance work is about forging trust and mutual respect, delivering ahead of promised deadlines.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Any Advice for the upcoming generations?</em>
              <br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong><em>Dare to Dream. </em></strong> A very powerful quote indeed. If you do not work for your own dreams, you will end up working for someone else's dreams. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Any Advice for the older generations?</em>
              <br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong><em>Everyone is on their own chapter.</em></strong> Everyone is running their own race, having their own timeline. Stop pitting yourself against other "successful" people. You will get there eventually; however, the journey is never easy. You have to persevere and someday you will make it but this is only if you do the right things. Don't ask me what's right and wrong. If your heart knows it, your mind will conceive what your heart has set for you to achieve.</p>
